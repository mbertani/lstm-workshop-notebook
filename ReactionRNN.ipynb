    "# Sentiment Analysis with reactionrnn\n",
    "Source: https://github.com/minimaxir/reactionrnn/blob/master/README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "reactionrnn is a Python 2/3 module + R package on top of Keras/TensorFlow which can easily predict the proportionate reactions (love, wow, haha, sad, angry) to a given text using a pretrained recurrent neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional sentiment analysis models using tools like [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)/[doc2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html), reactionrnn handles text at the character level, allowing it to incorporate capitalization, grammar, text length, and sarcasm in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "reactionrnn is based off of the blog post [Classifying the Emotions of Facebook Posts Using Reactions Data](http://minimaxir.com/2016/06/interactive-reactions/), which noted that there is a certain nuance to the proportionality of the reactions on a Facebook status. \n",
    "\n",
    "reactionrnn takes in an input of up to 140 characters (for compatability with Twitter tweets), converts each character to a 100D character embedding vector, and feeds those into a 256-cell [gated recurrent unit layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit). That output regresses the five non-Like Reactions all simultaneously and outputs the predicted proportionality values for each; predicted values will always sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep in mind that the network is trained on modern (2016-2017) language. As a result, inputting rhetorical/ironic statements will often yield love/wow responses and not sad/angry.\n",
    "- If a text sequence is >140 characters, reactionrnn will only use the first 140 characters.\n",
    "- Take a look at the blog post, since it is important that you familiarize yourself with the kind of data used to train the model."
